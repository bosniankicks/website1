1. ACO is never a guarentee. I will run release and restocks but I cannot ensure every time I will get the product. <br><br>
2. All info that is submitted must be correct. Any false info that needs to be updated must be sent 12 hours in advance. <br><br>
3. I AM NOT resonsible if an item is lost, damaged, stolen, or changed. I am only ordering the item for you.  <br><br>
4. There are no chargebacks, chargebacks will result in a ban from my ACO. <br><br>
5. All Fees will be listed by me individually.  <br><br>
6. Your information will be deleted after each drop. <br><br>
7. Thank You for using my ACO.
